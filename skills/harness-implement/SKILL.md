description: Orchestrate the entire IMPLEMENT phase — test-driven implementation of the approved plan, resolving build/type errors as they arise. Use after /harness-plan. Sequences /implement and /build-fix, delegates to subagents, and halts if reality diverges from the plan.

# /harness-implement — run the Implement phase

Thin orchestrator over the Implement skills. Requires an approved plan from
`/harness-claude:harness-plan` (or `/harness-claude:plan`). Refuse to start without one for non-trivial work.

## Sequence

1. For each plan phase, in order:
   - **`/harness-claude:implement`** — **delegate to the `harness-claude:tdd-guide` agent**: failing test (RED) →
     minimum code (GREEN) → refactor, against the phase's acceptance criteria.
   - **Parallel-fan-out check:** if the phase spans 3+ independent files with disjoint
     write-sets and no dependency, *offer* `/harness-claude:orchestrate` to fan the work out
     (opt-in — propose, don't auto-start a multi-agent run).
   - Let the format/typecheck/quality hooks run; act on what they surface.
   - If the build/types break and the fix isn't obvious → **`/harness-claude:build-fix`** (delegate to
     the `harness-claude:build-error-resolver` agent), minimal diffs only.
   - Confirm the phase's **exit check** (tests green, build clean) before the next phase.

2. **Plan-divergence gate:** if reality contradicts the plan (a phase is wrong, missing,
   or bigger than scoped), **HALT** — report the divergence, update the plan with the
   user, then resume. Never silently improvise scope.

## Rules
- Delegate search/exploration and isolated edits to cheaper models; keep the orchestrator
  focused on integration.
- Files stay modular and lean (<800 lines), immutable patterns, validated inputs.
- Compact at phase boundaries, not mid-phase.
- Do **not** run any git command.

## Output
Phase-by-phase summary (what was built, tests added, build status). Then hand off to
`/harness-claude:harness-verify`.
